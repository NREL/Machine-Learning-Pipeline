# Machine-Learning-Pipeline
The Pipeline Class is stored in the folder @Pipeline and consists of the functions: featureEngineering.m, featureSelection.m, fit.m, and evaluate.m. An example of how to use the Pipeline on publically available data from Severson et. al is given in Step2_RunPipeline.m, with Step1_LoadData.m loading that data set into the intended format for the pipeline.
